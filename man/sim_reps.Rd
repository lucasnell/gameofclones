\arguments{
\item{n_reps}{Number of reps to simulate.}

\item{n_patches}{Number of patches to simulate.}

\item{max_t}{Max time points to simulate for each rep.}

\item{R}{Growth rates for each line.}

\item{A}{Density dependence for each line.}

\item{D_vec}{Vector of \code{b0} values, where the predicted number of dispersed aphids is
given by \code{exp(b0) * N} when \code{N} is the number of total aphids.}

\item{process_error}{SD of process error. Set to 0 for no process error.}

\item{disp_error}{Boolean for whether to include dispersal stochasticity.}

\item{log_zeta_mean}{Mean of the distribution of log(zeta) values.}

\item{log_zeta_sd}{SD of the distribution of log(zeta) values.}

\item{zeta_t_thresh}{Threshold for \code{exp(zeta * (t - mu_time))} that makes that
patch get replaced. This is equivalent to the threshold for patch "health"
that would make an experimenter replace it.}

\item{mu_time}{Mean of time values.}

\item{repl_times}{Vector of times at which to replace patches.}

\item{repl_threshold}{Threshold above which patches are replaced.}

\item{extinct_N}{Threshold below which a line is considered extinct.}

\item{save_every}{Abundances will be stored every \code{save_every} time points.}

\item{by_patch}{Logical for whether to summarize abundances by patch, rather
than separately by line and patch.}

\item{n_cores}{Number of cores to use. Defaults to \code{1}.}

\item{show_progress}{Boolean for whether to show progress bar. Defaults to
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{line_names}{Vector of names to assign to lines.}

\item{N_0}{Starting abundances for each aphid line on each patch.
Can be a single number if you want the same value for each line on each patch,
or a matrix if you want to specify everything.}
