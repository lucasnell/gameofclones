This package contains code for the analysis and simulation of aphid population-growth
time series data.
These data are used to help understand the dynamics of clonal evolution in pea aphids.

## Project description

The aim for this project is to understand the mechanisms underlying clonal
evolution of pea aphid populations.
Specifically, we're interested in 3 main questions regarding outcomes of evolution
in this system:

1. How predictable are outcomes?
2. Do traits that differ among clones help predict outcomes?
3. How might complex patterns among multiple outcomes emerge?

To answer these questions, we're combining detailed population assays (growth,
dispersal, etc.), computer simulations, and experiments.
