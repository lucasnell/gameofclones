This package contains code for the analysis and simulation of aphid
population-growth time series data. These data are used to help
understand the dynamics of clonal evolution in pea aphids.

## Project description

The aim for this project is to understand the mechanisms underlying
clonal evolution of pea aphid populations. Specifically, we’re
interested in 3 main questions regarding outcomes of evolution in this
system:

1.  How predictable are outcomes?
2.  Do traits that differ among clones help predict outcomes?
3.  How might complex patterns among multiple outcomes emerge?

To answer these questions, we’re combining detailed population assays
(growth, dispersal, etc.), computer simulations, and experiments.
